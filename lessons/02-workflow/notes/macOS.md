# Notes: Navigating the Mac Operating System (iOS)

Note: in these notes, the words Mac OS, iOS, apple interface, and mac interface will all be used interchangeably.

You probably know there have been long battles between Windows and Mac users, but why do so many programmers have apple computers? There are lots of reasons, but one is because of the [UNIX shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) that apple computers are built upon. Easy access to the terminal (more on than in [Lesson 04](../../04-terminal/README.md)) means quick access to programming tools and development. But outside the terminal, there's a lot to become familiar with if you aren't used to working on a mac.
