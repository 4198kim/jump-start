Consider the following:
```ruby
d = 10
e = 5.0
f = 2
g = 11.0
h = 3
i = 1.5
```

| Op |   | Result | Data Type |
|:---: |:---:| :---: | :---: |
| d + e | evaluates to |   |   |
| f + h | evaluates to |  |  |
| g + h | evaluates to |  |  |
| d - f | evaluates to |  |  |
| g - e | evaluates to |  |  |
| (h + i) - f | evaluates to |  |  |
| (d - f) + e | evaluates to |   |   |



### Multiplication and Division ( *, / )  

| Op |   | Result | Data Type |
|:---: |:---:| :---: | :---: |
| d * f | evaluates to |  |  |
| g * i | evaluates to |  |  |
| f * g | evaluates to |  |  |
| d / f | evaluates to |  |  |
| d / e | evaluates to |  |  |
| e / f | evaluates to |  |  |
| (g * f) / f | evaluates to |  |  |
| (d / f) * e | evaluates to |  |  |
| 21 / 5 | evaluates to |  |  |
