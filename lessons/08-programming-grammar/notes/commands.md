# Notes: Commands

Ruby has many kinds of commands built into its _core library_. We can utilize these _commands_ along with _values_ to give Ruby instructions about what to do. For this lecture, we are going to cover a handful of commands:

- `Fixnum` & `Float` Commands:
  - `+`
  - `-`
  - `*`
  - `/`
- `String` Commands:
  - `+` (_string concatenation_)
  - `#{}` (_string interpolation_)
  - `print`
  - `puts`
  - `gets.chomp`
