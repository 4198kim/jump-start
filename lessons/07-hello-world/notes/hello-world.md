# Hello World

A "Hello World" program is the first program that most programmers create to explore a new programming language. Be sure to read the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) article which provides even more context about what this is and why we use it!

## irb

In the previous lesson, we saw what IRB is and how to execute a basic command in IRB. We can use IRB as our first attempt in creating a "Hello World" program.

1. Open terminal
2. Start IRB
3. `puts "hello world"`

## file
IRB is only one way of interacting with Ruby code. Next, let's do the same thing but create a Ruby file and execute that Ruby file instead of doing this directly in IRB.

### Create a Ruby File
From a location where you feel comfortable, run the command which will create a new file:  
`touch hello-world.rb`

### Edit the Ruby File
From the terminal, Open your text editor with the current folder's file:  
`atom .`

Edit the hello-world.rb file to add the `puts` statement:  
`puts "hello world"`

Save the file!

### Run the code
From the terminal, Run your code:  
`ruby hello-world.rb`

See the output? Great!

### Debug the code
