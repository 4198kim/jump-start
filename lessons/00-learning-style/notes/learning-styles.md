# Notes: Learning Styles

The term “learning styles” speaks to the understanding that every person learns differently. Technically, an individual’s learning style refers to the preferential way in which a person absorbs, processes, comprehends and retains information. For example, when learning how to build something, some people understand the process by following verbal instructions, others by reading the instructions, others by seeing a demonstration first, and others have to physically manipulate the clock themselves.
