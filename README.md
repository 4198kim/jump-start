# Ada Developers Academy Jump Start

This repository contains the materials presented during the [Ada Developers Academy](adadevelopersacademy.org) jump start program. This program is intended for accepted Ada Developers Academy students to give them a jump start on learning materials and concepts that will be utilized throughout our year-long program.

## Learning Goals
_Problem Solving_  
Breaking down complex problems is a fundamental skill as a software engineer. While we will be doing this for years to come, we want to give you an opportunity to explore problem solving in programatic ways an exploring topics like:
- input
- output
- algorithms
- variable substitution

_Learning Style_  
Whether you have gone through a traditional post-secondary program recently or not, coming to the Ada classroom can be an adjustment for many folks. It is good to get a gauge on your learning style as soon as possible to be able to jump right in on day one and absorb the material in a way that works well for you.

_Workflow_  
Learning to become a programmer is based a lot in using your computer in the most efficient way possible so you can focus on the difficult problems rather than navigating your computer.

_Exposure to Programming_  
Our year-long program will go from basics to advanced topics throughout the seven month curriculum. To give everyone an similar jump-off point, we want to ensure that all students have been exposed to programming and programming concepts including:
- variables
- data structures
- substitution
- patterns
